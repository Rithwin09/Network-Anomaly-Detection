# Network-Anomaly-Detection
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in network traffic using various machine learning models. Anomalies in networks can indicate potential security threats like intrusions, attacks, or data breaches. By analyzing network behavior patterns, the system identifies outliers and abnormal activity that deviate from normal usage
